<h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
    We are a small animal shelter. <br>
    Since 2022, we have been finding a permanent and temporary home for dogs and cats. <br>
    All animals in the shelter are sterilized and examined by a veterinarian. <br>
    </p>

            <a href="{% url 'register' %}">Register and become a Volunteer</a> <br>
            Even if you canâ€™t adopt a pet just now, you can help make life better for animals by volunteering with our shelter.
